            <p style="font-size:16px; color:black; margin:20px;">Judgments of force are pervasive in legal, philosophical, and everyday thinking. By analyzing responses from the survey you just completed, we are examining the complex ways in which judgments of force may interface with moral attributions - equally prevalent in legal, philosophical, and everyday thinking. </p> \
            <p style="font-size:16px; color:black; margin:20px;font-weight: bold"> How is this being tested? </p>\
            <p style="font-size:16px; color:black; margin:20px"> You were presented with information about whether a person was forced to do an unspecified action and then asked to predict what that person did from a set of potential actions. By varying the initial condition (whether or not said person was forced), we can study the effect judgments of force may have on action selection. </p>\
            <p style="font-size:16px; color:black; margin:20px;font-weight: bold"> Main questions and hypotheses: </p>\
            <p style="font-size:16px; color:black; margin:20px"> The fundamental goal of this research is to determine whether judgments of force constrain moral appraisals. In this specific case, the question was whether or not moral judgments would influence candidate action selection. We hypothesized that people would, on average, select morally worse actions in cases where they were told that the captain was forced than in those cases where the captain was not. </p>\
            <p style="font-size:16px; color:black; margin:20px; font-weight: bold"> Why is this important to study? </p>\
            <p style="font-size:16px; color:black; margin:20px"> Understanding the relationship between judgments of force and moral appraisals has massive consequences for several domains, including the legal realm. Suppose a jury is deciding whether a defendant is guilty of a crime - the details of which are inaccessible to them (an all too common occurrence) - but they know whether or not the defendant was forced to commit the crime. Here, if judgments of force incorrectly influence moral appraisals (of the defendant’s actions), the consequences would be disastrous. </p>\
